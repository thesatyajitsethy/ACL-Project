# ACL-Project
To prevent unauthorized access, we’ll set up ACLs so Team 1, working on Website 1, can’t access Website 2, and Team 2, working on Website 2, can’t access Website 1. ACLs will define access rules based on network addresses and user roles to enforce these restrictions and maintain data security.
In this company, there are two websites—Website 1 and Website 2—and each has its own dedicated team of developers. Team 1 works on Website 1, and Team 2 works on Website 2. However, it has come to my attention that developers from Team 1 have been accessing data from Website 2, and developers from Team 2 have been doing the same with Website 1. To address this, we need to configure access control lists (ACLs) to ensure that Team 1 can only access and work on Website 1, while Team 2 can only access and work on Website 2.
